### Q1: What is Ohm's Law?

**A:** Ohm's Law states that Voltage (V) = Current (I) Ã— Resistance (R). It describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit.

### Q2: What is the difference between AC and DC current?

**A:** AC (Alternating Current) changes direction periodically, while DC (Direct Current) flows in only one direction continuously.

---

### Q3: What is the difference between series and parallel connections?

**A:**  
- **Series connection:** Components are connected one after another. Current is the same throughout, but voltage is divided.  
- **Parallel connection:** Components are connected across the same voltage. Voltage remains the same, but current is divided.

### Q4: What is an MCB and how does it work?

**A:** MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) is a safety device that automatically cuts off the circuit in case of overload or short circuit, preventing damage and fire.

---

### Q5: Why is grounding important?

**A:** Grounding ensures safety by redirecting excess voltage or current to the earth, reducing the risk of electric shock or equipment damage.
